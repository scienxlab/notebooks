# notebooks

A collection of Jupyter Notebooks on various scientific topics, especially interesting for subsurface scientists.

## Sources

Nearly all of these notebooks will likely need updating. Some are totally obselete and will not be worth rescuing.

* I did [a blog series](https://agilescientific.com/blog/category/X+Lines) called "X lines of Python", all nice and short â€” [Notebooks here](https://github.com/agilescientific/xlines)
* Nearly all the 30-ish SEG tutorials have a notebook / code: [https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Geophysical_tutorials](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Geophysical_tutorials)
* Some of my gists are pretty short: [https://gist.github.com/kwinkunks](https://gist.github.com/kwinkunks), eg [this one](https://gist.github.com/kwinkunks/33dc88629cabf8311a1a506fbee85719) is quite good, also [this one](https://gist.github.com/kwinkunks/ddf3c6f781eadeac51f19d5cd1ebe617)
